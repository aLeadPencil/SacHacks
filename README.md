analyse home vs away game wins/losses
- who performed well? better/worse than expected. Expectation(performance) being the mean
 regression to predict stats for the next game idk lol
 
- ticket sales vs attendance? more attendance == better team performance?
- trend in performance during holidays? correlation maybe (i.e. harden and stripclubs)

def SVM():
    if sac wins: 
      red
    else 
      blue
    
    plot both teams scores on a scatter plot, try to classify like this weekends, next weeks, next months game...
    find boundary, intepret which teams like on either side of the boundary
